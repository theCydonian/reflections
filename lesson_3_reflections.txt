When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Always; you can lose everything on your computer at any time.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If you break something locally, you would not want it to be uploaded.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
When you clone a repository, you make a copy of a repository on GitHub on to your computer. When you fork, you make a duplicate of someone else's repository on GitHub's servers. Your project is connected. When you branch you make version of your repository locally.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can merge or work on it online.
