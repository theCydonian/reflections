When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Always; you can lose everything on your computer at any time.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If you break something locally, you would not want it to be uploaded.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
When you clone a repository, you make a copy of a repository on GitHub on to your computer. When you fork, you make a duplicate of someone else's repository on GitHub's servers. Your project is connected. When you branch you make version of your repository locally.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can merge or work on it offline

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Without git or github I would just share a dropbox folderwith someone. This would barely work because there is no merge, so simultaneous work on the project would be near impossible. Git and Github would be much easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
You might want to do that if you are making a separate version or experimental chages. You may also want to do that when you are collaborating. That way you don't direvtly change something someone else was working on. when you're working by yourself it might be better just to use main so everything is in one place.
